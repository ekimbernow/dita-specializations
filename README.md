## OASIS TC Open Repository: dita-specializations

This GitHub public repository [dita-specializations](https://github.com/oasis-open/dita-specializations) was created at the request of the [OASIS Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/dita/) as an [OASIS TC Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/) to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.

## Statement of Purpose

This repository provides storage for DITA specializations that were developed by the DITA TC, but which are no longer part of the DITA standard.

Initially, this repository contains the grammar files for the following DITA 1.3 specializations:

1. Learning and training
2. Machinery task
3. Task requirements domain
1. Classification map
1. Classification domain
1. Delayed conref resolution domain

This public development project has been started by the DITA TC, but will depend on participation from the larger DITA user community in order to maintain the specializations and keep them compatible with the latest release of the DITA standard.
